	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input data. An efficient algorithm is one that has a low time complexity, meaning it can process large amounts of data quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run as a function of the size of the input data. It is typically expressed using Big O notation, such as <b>O(n)</b>, where 'n' represents the size of the input. Managing Space Complexity is crucial in scenarios where memory is a limited resource.
